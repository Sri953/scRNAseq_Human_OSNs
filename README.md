# Discovering Triggers of Action Potentials in Human Olfactory Sensory Neurons
This repository contains the full workflow for identifying gene expression profiles of the axon initial segment in human olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) using single-cell transcriptomic datasets.
The project as divided into 3 subaims:
- Comparison of AIS gene expression in cortical neurons and OSNs
- Understanding developmental changes using trajectory analysis
- Understadning changes in signal transduction in patients who have lost their sense of smell due to COVID-19 or old age.

## Data Sources for OSNs
All datasets downloaded were pre-processed single-cell RNA-seq data which included 3 files of gene read counts, gene names, and barcode allocations.
- Healthy OSN Dataset: GSE139522 and GSE184117 
- COVID-19 Dataset: GSE201620
- Presbyosmic Dataset: GSE184117

## Data Source for Cortical Neurons
Single cell RNA-seq profiles of human cortical neurons from the primary visual cortex used as a reference population for comparison.
Obtained from the Human Brain Cell Atlas.
